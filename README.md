Welcome to the Snakes and Ladders game, a classic board game that has been adapted into a graphical user interface (GUI) using Python's Tkinter library. This game is designed for two players, where each player takes turns rolling a dice to move across the board, climbing ladders and avoiding snakes. The first player to reach or exceed position 100 wins the game.


How to Play
Starting the Game:

The game begins with Player 1's turn.
Rolling the Dice:

Player 1 clicks the "Roll Dice" button. The dice roll result (a number between 1 and 6) will be displayed, and Player 1's position on the board will be updated.
If Player 1 lands on a snake, they will slide down to a lower position. If they land on a ladder, they will climb up to a higher position.
After Player 1's turn, Player 2 will automatically take their turn in the same manner.
Winning the Game:

The first player to reach or exceed position 100 wins the game. A message will be displayed indicating the winner.
Once a player wins, the "Roll Dice" button will be disabled to indicate the end of the game.
6. Game Rules
Players move forward according to the number rolled on the dice.
If a player lands on a ladder, they move up to the position indicated by the ladder.
If a player lands on a snake, they slide down to the position indicated by the snake.
The first player to reach or exceed position 100 is declared the winner.
